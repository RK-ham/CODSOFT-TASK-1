# CodSoft Data Science Internship - Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

**Intern**: Roshini K  
**Duration**: 30 Days  
**Mode**: Virtual  
**Domain**: Data Science  
**Task Title**: Titanic Survival Prediction  
**Video Demo**: [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/-fm2SbsQBGo)

## Objective
To build a classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, class, and fare.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded and preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, removed irrelevant columns)
- Converted categorical data (Sex) to numerical
- Used logistic regression for classification
- Evaluated accuracy and performance
- Visualized survival rates by gender and feature correlation heatmap

## Tools and Libraries Used
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, train_test_split, accuracy_score)

## Output
Achieved approximately 78% prediction accuracy.
